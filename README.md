## Improvements (If More Time Available)

- Add a backend API with Node.js/Express to store data securely.  
- Implement user authentication and login for patients and doctors.  
- Enhance appointment validation (e.g., no double booking).  
- Add calendar integration and reminders.  
- Improve accessibility (ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation).  
- Add animations and more advanced UI feedback.  
- Use TypeScript for static typing and better developer experience.

## Challenges Faced & Solutions

- **State management:** Chose React hooks and localStorage for simplicity.  
- **Form validation:** Implemented client-side checks for required fields and valid email format.  
- **Routing state:** Passed appointment data via React Router `location.state` to the success page.  
- **Responsive UI:** Used Tailwind CSS utility classes to build a mobile-friendly layout.  
- **Toast positioning:** Customized react-hot-toast to show notifications at screen center for better visibility.
